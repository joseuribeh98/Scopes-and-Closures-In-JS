# Scopes and Closures in JavaScript

This repository is dedicated to providing examples and explanations about the concepts of Scopes and Closures in JavaScript.

## Contents

The repository contains various code files illustrating different aspects of scopes and closures in JavaScript.

## Scopes

In JavaScript, a Scope is the current execution context. The context in which variables are declared can affect where we can access these variables in our code.

## Closures

A Closure is a function that has access to the scope of its outer function, even after the outer function has completed.
